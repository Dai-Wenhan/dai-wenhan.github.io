### About Me

Now I am an undergraduate student in [School of Mathematical Science](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), China. My research interest includes **number theory**, **arithmetic geometry**, and **representation theory**. My instructor is Professor [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm) / 肖梁 at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn).
