Hi!

### About Me

Now I am an undergraduate student in [School of Mathematical Science](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), China. My research interest includes **number theory**, **arithmetic geometry**, and **representation theory**. My instructor is Professor [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm) / 肖梁 at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn). 

During the upcoming 2023-2024, I will be an international exchange student to [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.com), France; with the support of Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC), I will be under the supervision of Professor [Sophie Morel](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/sophie.morel/) (she had moved to ENS Lyon from [somewhere else](https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/sophie-morel)).

## Recent Updates

1. **IMPORTANT:** Notes for [IHES 2022 Summer School on the Langlands Program](./IHES22/IHES22.md).
2. 在2022秋选修肖梁老师《代数学(实验班)》的同学们：[电子版课程笔记](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/2022fall/Honors-algebra.pdf)正在龟速更新中(最近更新: 11/4), 我们保证更新进度不落后于实际课程进度. 若有预习需求, 在[课程主页](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/2022fall/2022fall.htm)上可以看到手写版的笔记.
3. (Notes updated) During the upcoming semester, I will organize [seminars on Abelian / Shimura varieties](./AV/AV.md). 


### Ongoing Events

- [**Abelian Varieties (I)**](./AV/AV.md) (student seminar for the 3+X Program).

  The goal of this learning seminar is to study the basics of abelian varieties. The pre-requisite is Chapters 2–3 of Hartshorne’s algebraic geometry, but this seminar can also be taken while reading Hartshorne’s book. Some familiarity with elliptic curves will be helpful to understand some of the materials. Each lecture will be two hours long. The textbook we are going to use is Mumford’s book. Another complementary reference is Milne’s online note. Mumford’s book is mostly about the geometry (i.e. abelian varieties over algebraically closed fields), while Milne’s note has more about the arithmetic (e.g. abelian varieties over finite fields or number fields). Moreover, Milne’s note has a chapter about Jacobian varieties.
  - **Time**: Every Friday, 7:30-9:30pm.
  - **Location**: School of Math 1418.
  - **Instructor**: [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm) and [Xinyi Yuan](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~yxy/).

- [**Lectures on mod _p_ Langlands program for GL(2)**](./ModpLL2022/ModpLL2022.md) (advanced guest lecture series).

  This lecture series aims to give an introduction to some recent progress on the mod _p_ Langlands program for GL(2). (_Caveat: This series of courses contains a great deal of difficult and profound representational expertise that an audience unfamiliar with the field will not gain from._)
  - **Lecturer**: [Yongquan Hu](http://www.mcm.ac.cn/faculty/huyongquan/201509/t20150909_306981.html) (MCM, AMSS).
  - **Other Invited Participants**: Yiwen Ding, Ruochuan Liu, Yichao Tian, Haoran Wang, Liang Xiao, etc..
  - **Time**: November 2 - November 16, 2022.
  - **Venue**: Lecture Hall, 82J12, Jingchunyuan 82, BICMR.

- [**_p_-adic Geometry Learning Seminar: On Banach-Colmez Spaces**](./padicBC/padicBC.md).

  The goal of this series of talks is to learn the basics of finite-dimensional Banach Spaces (aka. Banach-Colmez spaces). More details can be found here. There is a small chance we might have to deviate from this schedule if some topics end up taking longer/shorter than we expect.
  - **Time**: Every Monday, 3:00-5:00pm.
  - **Location**: MCM 110 & Online (Zoom ID: 4663562952; Password: mcm1234).
  - **Instructor**: Koji Shimizu (Tsinghua) and [Shizhang Li](http://shizhang.li) (MCM).

- [**On the Ternary Goldbach Problem**](./Goldbach/Goldbach.md) (for fun only).

  A coffee-break-seminar on additive and combinatoric number theory. We plan to follow [Ben Green's lecture notes](https://courses-archive.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/view_material/49404) (Oxon ver in 2020) closely.
  - **Time**: October-November 2022; typically irregular. (Contact the organizers to join the WeChat group for detailed time syllabus.)
  - **Venue**: Coffee Bar at Jingchun Yuan (behind Room 77201), BICMR; or alternatively, the Paradiso Coffee (泊星地咖啡) at Yan Yuan.
