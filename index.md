## About Me

<img src="./headshot-new.jpeg" alt="headshot" style="float:left;margin:0.5rem 1.5rem 0.5rem 0rem;width:200px" /> 

I am currently a graduate student in pure mathematics at [National University of Singapore](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg) and my advisor is [David Hansen](http://www.davidrenshawhansen.net); I spent my previous two academic years 2023 and 2024 at [Qiuzhen Colledge, Tsinghua University](https://qzc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I was partially advised by [Yihang Zhu](https://yhzhumath.github.io). I obtained my B.Sc. in mathematics from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) in 2023, supervised by [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm).

I study and work on number theory, arithmetic geometry, and representation theory. My interest mainly lies in explicit aspects of the **categorical local Langlands correspondence**; I am also boardly interested in **geometric Langlands** and **relative Langlands**.
