Hi!

### About Me

Since 2023 Fall, I am a first-year graduate student at [Yau Mathematical Sciences Center](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn) (YMSC), China. I work on number theory, arithmetic geometry, and representation theory; my research interest includes **_p_-adic geometry**, **categorical Langlands**, and **geometric Langlands**.

Previously, I got my B.A. in mathematics at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) in June 2023. My supervisor was Professor [Liang XIAO](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm) / 肖梁 at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn) (BICMR). 

A headshot of mine is posted [here](./headshot.jpg).

**Regarding language skills:** Chinese native speaker; fluent in English and French at work.


## Recent Updates

1. In 2024 Spring, I will work as the teaching assistant for [Geometric Representation Theory 1](https://windshower.github.io/linchen/teaching/s2024.html) (Lecturer: [Lin Chen](https://windshower.github.io/linchen/)).


### Ongoing/Upcoming Events

#### 2024 Spring

- [**Seminar on Relative Langlands Duality (II)**](./BZSV/BZSV2.md). <br/>
  _To study the new work by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh, about the global conjecture and Devalapurkar's recent rank-one local proof._
