Hi!

### About Me

Now I am an undergraduate student in [School of Mathematical Science](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), China. My research interest includes **number theory**, **arithmetic geometry**, and **representation theory**. My instructor is Professor [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm) / 肖梁 at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn). 

During the upcoming 2023-2024, I will be an international exchange student to [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.com), France; with the support of Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC), I will be under the supervision of Professor [Sophie Morel](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/sophie.morel/) (she had moved to ENS Lyon from [somewhere else](https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/sophie-morel)). 

A headshot of mine is posted [here](./headshot.jpg).

Regarding language skills: Chinese native speaker; fluent in English and French at work.

## Recent Updates

1. **IMPORTANT:** Notes for [**IHES 2022 Summer School on the Langlands Program**](./IHES22/IHES22.md).
2. **To appear:** [**Modularity lifting**](./miscellanea/modlift.pdf) (Patrick Allen's McGill lectures).

### Ongoing/Upcoming Events

- [**Rigid and Formal Geometry**](./rigid/rigid.md).

  The goal of this learning seminar is to study basics of rigid analytic geometry, and at the same time to prepare for the topic course given by Yiwen Ding in the Spring semester on perfectoid spaces. The pre-requisite is Chapters 2-3 of Hartshorne’s algebraic geometry. Some basic familiarity with _p_-adic numbers is needed. Each lecture will be two hours long. The main reference we propose is Part I of Siegfried Bosch's book _Lectures on Formal and Rigid Geometry_. This reference is wonderful in that the logic flow is very clear, but the drawback is the lack of concrete examples and philosophical explanations. We recommend frequent consultation of Kedlaya’s lecture notes for intuitions and exercises.
  - **Instructor**: [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm).
  - **Organizers**: Shanxiao Huang, Yuji Yang. 
  - **Time**: January 3-February 9; 14:00-16:00 on every Monday and Thursday, except the week of Chinese New Year. 
  - **Venue**: Online via Zoom, TBA.

- [**Instructional workshop on Iwasawa theory for automorphic forms**](./Iwasawa2022/Iwasawa2022.md) (online, Korean Institute for Advanced Study).

  Recently, there have been significant progresses in Iwasawa theory for elliptic curves and modular forms. Remarkably, these progresses have important applications to the cerebrated Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, one of the Millennium Prize Problems. The main goal of this instructional workshop is to go through many details of the recent work of Castella, Liu, and Wan on the Iwasawa main conjecture for automorphic forms on GU(3,1) ([arXiv:2109.08375](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08375)). In particular, this work plays an important role to establish the Iwasawa main conjecture for a large class of elliptic curves with supersingular reduction.
  - **Time**: December 19-22, 2022.
  - **Instructor**: [Francesc Castella](https://web.math.ucsb.edu/~castella/) (UCSB), [Zheng Liu](https://web.math.ucsb.edu/~zliu/) (UCSB), [Xin Wan](http://www.mcm.ac.cn/people/members/202011/t20201113_593075.html) (Morningside Center of Mathematics, CAS).

- [**On the Ternary Goldbach Problem**](./Goldbach/Goldbach.md) (for fun only).

  A coffee-break-seminar on additive and combinatoric number theory. We plan to follow [Ben Green's lecture notes](https://courses-archive.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/view_material/49404) (Oxon ver in 2020) closely.
  - **Time**: October-November 2022; typically irregular. (Contact the organizers to join the WeChat group for detailed time syllabus.)
  - **Venue**: Coffee Bar at Jingchun Yuan (behind Room 77201), BICMR; or alternatively, the Paradiso Coffee (泊星地咖啡) at Yan Yuan.
