### Contents

1. **Basic height theory** ([notes](././1.pdf), [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jr4y117wZ/)) - <br/>
**Time**：09:00-10:20, Sep 25th. <br/>
**Speaker**：Liang Xiao, Peking University. <br/>
**Abstract**：The goal is to introduce Weil's height machine, Neron-Tate height of abelian varieties, and the application to the Mordell-Weil theorem.


2. **Basic Arakelov theory** ([notes](././2.pdf), [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ST4y1R78E/)) - <br/>
**Time**：10:30-11:50, Sep 25th. <br/>
**Speaker**：Shun Tang, Capital Normal University. <br/>
**Abstract**：This lecture introduces arithmetic divisors and hermitian line bundles over arithmetic varieties, and defines their top intersection numbers. Define height functions associated to hermitian line bundles. Introduce ampleness, bigness, nefness of hermitian line bundles.

3. **Basics on the moduli spaces of curves** ([notes](././3.pdf), [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1J44y147zp/)) - <br/>
**Time**：13:30-14:30, Sep 25th. <br/>
**Speaker**：Tong Zhang, East China Normal University. <br/>
**Abstract**：This is a review of the definition and GIT construction of the moduli spaces of smooth curves and stable curves. Introduce the tautological divisors (Hodge bundle, boundary divisors) over the moduli space of stable curves. Introduce Noether's formula.

4. **Introduction to the Mordell conjecture** ([notes](././4.pdf), [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1534y1m7iy/)) - <br/>
**Time**：14:40-15:40, Sep 25th. <br/>
**Speaker**：Xinyi Yuan, Peking University. <br/>
**Abstract**：This is an overview of the proofs of the Mordell conjecture, with some details on Vojta's proof (simplified by Faltings, Bombieri).

5. **Introduction to Berkovich spaces** ([notes](././5.pdf), [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13L4y1z7W3/)) - <br/>
**Time**：16:10-17:10, Sep 25th. <br/>
**Speaker**：Junyi Xie, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. <br/>
**Abstract**：This is an outline of the theory of Berkovich analytic spaces. It will also cover metrized line bundles, and Green's functions over Berkovich spaces.

6. **Introduction to the Bogomolov conjecture** ([notes](././6.pdf), [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1c44y1i7CT/)) - <br/>
**Time**：17:20-18:20, Sep 25th. <br/>
**Speaker**：Junyi Xie, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. <br/>
**Abstract**：This is an introduction to various forms of the Bogomolov conjecture, with some details on some lower bound for curves in terms of the phi-invariant following Zhang, Cinkir, de Jong.

7. **Uniform Mordell-Lang and uniform Bogomolov (I)** ([notes](././7.pdf), [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BL411G7Ca/)) - <br/>
**Time**：9:00-10:20, Sep 26th. <br/>
**Speaker**：Xinyi Yuan, Peking University. <br/>
**Abstract**：This is an introduction to the recent results on the uniform Mordell-Lang problem and the uniform Bogomolov problem of Dimitrov-Habegger-Gao, Kühne and Yuan. We will focus on Yuan's approach.
