## Algebraic Geometry II

_Spring 2023, at Peking University._

**Readme:** This semester I host the office hour seminar on _Algebraic Geometry II_. This page is dedicated to updating my comments and notes for [Zhiyu Tian](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~tianzhiyu/index.html)'s course. Some comments may particularly record the questions raised by some students during office hours; other notes of mine would closely refer to Grothendieck's EGA and SGA. 

**Prerequisites:** This course requires a (possibly superficial) understanding to fundamentals of scheme theory and sheaf theory. It would be sufficient if one had finished the course _Algebraic Geometry I_ or read about, for example, Chapter II of Hartshorne's textbook. See this [exam problems collection](././pre-exam.pdf) (Algebraic Geometry I, 2022 Fall) to test yourself.

**Caveat:** _Using these files incorrectly can possibly lead to some misunderstanding, and hopefully, you are thus expected to regard Hartshorne's book as the primary material for reading. However, please feel free to refer to my notes when you encounter (either mathematical or linguistic) obstacles in reading EGA and SGA._
