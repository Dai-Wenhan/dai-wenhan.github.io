## _p_-adic Geometry Learning Seminar: On Banach-Colmez Spaces.

  The goal of this series of talks is to learn the basics of finite-dimensional Banach Spaces (aka. Banach-Colmez spaces). More details can be found here. There is a small chance we might have to deviate from this schedule if some topics end up taking longer/shorter than we expect.
  - **Time**: Every Monday, 3:00-5:00pm.
  - **Location**: MCM 110 & Online (Zoom ID: 4663562952; Password: mcm1234).
