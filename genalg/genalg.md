## Algebra for the Generals

**Instruction Watch:** This page mainly covers the algebraic necessary to pass the graduateâ€™s general qualifying examinations at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn) (and possibly other universities and institutes say). To a large extent, these verbal responses are only informative for the interview. The frequently-asked questions are compiled from a large number of interview transcripts in [Generals at Princeton](https://web.math.princeton.edu/generals/index.html), and (unfortunately) the answers are still incomplete. I would appreciate any corrections if my mistakes are revealed.
