## Seminar on Lawrence–Venkatesh’s proof of the Mordell conjecture

  The purpose of this weekly seminar is to study Lawrence–Venkatesh’s proof of the Mordell conjecture. The main reference is [LV], and the survey [Po] gives a quick sketch for beginners. All talks will be given by participants, and each meeting will be about 90 minutes.
  - **Organizer:** [Xinyi Yuan](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~yxy/).
  - **Time:** 10:30–12:00 Wednesdays (starting on March 1).
  - **Venue:** Jia-yi-bing Big Lecture Hall, Jingchun Yuan.


### Schedule (tentative)

- [x] (3/1) **Xinyi Yuan** - Introduction and organization. I will review Faltings’ proof and sketch the main idea of [LV]’s proof. ([notes](././LV1.pdf))
- [x] (3/8) **Han Hu** - Review of the _p_-adic comparison theorems (étale / de Rham / crystalline). This is not in the paper, need an expert to do it. (see my addendum [notes](././LV2.pdf))
- [ ] (3/15) **** - §3 of [LV]. Application of the comparison theorems to the Diophantine situation.
- [ ] (3/22) **** - §4 of [LV]. Prove the _S_-unit theorem. This is a baby case prior to the Mordell conjecture.
- [ ] (3/29) **** - §5 of [LV]. Outline the proof of Mordell. Give a proof of [LV, Lemma 2.3] following [Wu, Proposition 2.7].
- [ ] (4/5) **** - §6 of [LV]. This is to prove the technical Proposition 5.3 in §5.
- [ ] (4/12) **** - §7 of [LV]. Introduce the Kodaira–Parshin construction. This is purely geometric.
- [ ] (4/19) **** - §8 of [LV]. Compute monodromy of the Kodaira–Parshin construction. This is done over complex field by topological methods. Sketch the proof.
- [ ] (4/26) **** - Up to now, the proof of Mordell is complete. The following is about families of hypersurfaces.
- [ ] (No talk on PKU spring holidays.)
- [ ] (5/10) **** - §9 of [LV]. The Bakker–Tsimerman theorem on on the period map.
- [ ] (5/17) **** - §10 of [LV]. Proof of the main result on families of hypersurfaces.
- [ ] (5/24) **** - §11 of [LV]. Proof of Proposition 10.6, which is mainly combinatorics and linear algebra.
