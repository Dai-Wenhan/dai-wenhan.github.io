## Lie Algebra and Representations

Lie algebras form a fundamental class of mathematical objects that are not only important for the study of algebra, but also have numerous applications in mathematical fields such as differential geometry and even in physics. This course introduces the basics of finite-dimensional complex Lie algebras, with emphasis on the structure and classification of complex semisimple Lie algebras, and will also briefly discuss the basic properties of the representations.

[Prepared notes](././Lie.pdf) for a mini-course given by Professor [Jinpeng An](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/anjp/) (Peking University) at the invitation of [Tianyuan Mathematical Center in Southwest China](http://tianyuan.scu.edu.cn/) in February 2022. 

The course closely follows [Hum12] and [Car05].
