## 3264 and All That.

_Seminar on Enumerative Geometry._

The number in the title of this book is a reference to the solution of a classic problem in enumerative geometry: the determination, by Chasles, of the number of smooth conic plane curves tangent to five given general conics. The problem is emblematic of the dual nature of the subject.
