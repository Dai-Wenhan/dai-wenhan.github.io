## Abelian Varieties (II)

_Student seminar for the 3+X program._

See also [**Abelian Varieties (I)**](https://dai-wenhan.github.io/AV/AV.html) (2022 Fall).

The goal of this learning seminar is to study the basics of abelian varieties. The pre-requisite is Chapters 2–3 of Hartshorne's algebraic geometry, but this seminar can also be taken while reading Hartshorne's book. Some familiarity with elliptic curves will be helpful to understand some of the materials. Each lecture will be two hours long.

The textbook we are going to use is Mumford's book [Mum]. Another complementary reference is Milne's online note [Mil]. Mumford's book is mostly about the geometry (i.e. abelian varieties over algebraically closed fields), while Milne's note has more about the arithmetic (e.g. abelian varieties over finite fields or number fields). Moreover, Milne's note has a chapter about Jacobian varieties.
- **Time:** Every Saturday, 7:00-9:00pm, during 2023 Spring semester.

- **Instructor:** [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm).


### Syllabus (tentative)

_I will not take handwritten notes for some talks during this semester. Instead, a TeXed readable version of notes will be uploaded at the end._

- [x] (2/25) **Liang Xiao:** Review and preview. 
- [x] (3/4) **Zhi Zheng:** [Mum, §16]. 
- [x] (3/11) **Jiachen Chen:** [Mum, §17-18]. A nice exercise is to deduce Kodaira's vanishing theorem for abelian varieties (over any field). 
- [ ] (3/18) **Xiaozheng Han:** [Mum, §19]. ([notes](././17.pdf))
- [ ] (3/25) _No seminar; Liang Xiao away._
- [ ] (4/1) **Huishi Yu:** [Mum, §20]. ([notes](././18.pdf))
- [ ] (4/8) **Liang Xiao:** [Mum, §21]. ([notes](././19.pdf))
- [ ] (4/15) _No seminar; Liang Xiao away._
- [ ] (4/22) **Zhanhao Yu:** [Mum, §22]. ([notes](././20.pdf))
- [ ] (5/1) _No seminar; Liang Xiao away._
- [ ] (5/13) **Xingzhu Fang:** [Mum, §23-24]. ([notes](././21.pdf))
- [ ] (5/20) **Haoda Li:** [Mum, §23-24]. ([notes](././22.pdf))
- [ ] (5/27) **Xiaolong Hu:** §III.1-III.6 of [Mil]. Sketch the theory of Jacobian varieties. ([notes](././23.pdf))
- [ ] (6/3) **Shun Yin:** §IV.2 of [Mil] Sketch a proof of Tate's theorem over finite fields. This is also in Appendix I of [Mum], but Milne's approach is simplified with Zarhin's trick on principal polarizations. ([notes](././24.pdf))
- [ ] (6/10) **Han Hu:** Appendix II of [Mum] Sketch a proof of the Mordell–Weil theorem. ([notes](././25.pdf))
