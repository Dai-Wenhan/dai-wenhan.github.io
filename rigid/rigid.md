## Rigid and Formal Geometry.

The goal of this learning seminar is to study basics of rigid analytic geometry, and at the same time to prepare for the topic course given by Yiwen Ding in the Spring semester on perfectoid spaces. The pre-requisite is Chapters 2-3 of Hartshorne's algebraic geometry. Some basic familiarity with $p$-adic numbers is needed. Each lecture will be two hours long. The main reference we propose is Part I of Siegfried Bosch's book _Lectures on Formal and Rigid Geometry_. This reference is wonderful in that the logic flow is very clear, but the drawback is the lack of concrete examples and philosophical explanations. We recommend frequent consultation of Kedlaya's lecture notes for intuitions and exercises.

  Cover [Bos] Sect. 3.1, 3.2. State some immediate consequences from last chapter for affinoid algebras (Prop. 3-5). Then discuss the residue norm and the supremum norm and their relations, in particular, prove Thm. 17 and show that all residue norms are equivalent (Prop. 20). Finally, introduce the affinoid spaces (Sect. 3.2).

If time permits, discuss the generalized version of Tate's acyclic theorem (Thm. 10, Cor. 11) (For more details, see [BGR] Chap. 8).
- [x] (1/30) **Tianwei Gao** - Grothendieck topologies and Rigid spaces. ([TeXed notes](././7-8.pdf), [speaker's handout](././7a.pdf), [appendix](././7b.pdf)) <br/>
  Cover [Bos] P93-P106. Define Grothendieck topology and understand the strong Grothendieck topologies on affinoid spaces. In particular, prove Sect. 5.1, Cor. 10. Then discuss the sheaves on $G$-topological spaces and prove Sect. 5.2, Prop. 4. Finally, define the rigid $K$-spaces.

  [Bos] P106-P116. Finish Sect. 5.3. Construct the rigid analytifications of $K$-schemes of locally finite type and prove Sect. 5.4. Prop. 4. Then discuss the examples in the rest of Sect. 5.4.
