## Seminar on Relative Langlands Duality (II)

This seminar focuses on the recent work of Ben-Zvi-Sakellaridis-Venkatesh [BZSV] on relative Langlands duality. The aim of this seminar is to understand the work Relative Langlands Duality by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh, abbreviated as [BZSV] in what follows. We have completed the Parts 1 (structure theory of hyperspherical Hamiltonian varieties) and 2 (local theory) via [Seminar on Relative Langlands Duality (I)](././BZSV1.md) in Fall 2023. In this semester, we plan to continue with the Parts 3 (global theory) and 4 (local-to-global aspects), by following the linear order in [BZSV].
