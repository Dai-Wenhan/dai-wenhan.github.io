### Syllabus

- [x] (4/7) **Liang Xiao:** Talk 1 -- Introduction to ghost conjecture and its local version. ([notes](././1.pdf)) <br/>
_Review the ghost conjecture raised by Bergdall and Pollack in [BP16+, BP17+]. Explain the formulation of local ghost conjecture following [LTXZ1, §2]._

- [x] (4/7) **Liang Xiao:** Talk 2 -- Application of ghost conjectures. ([notes](././2.pdf)) <br/> 
_Give an overview of the proof of ghost conjecture and introduce its applications following [LTXZ2, §1]._

- [x] (4/7) **Ruochuan Liu:** Talk 3 -- Abstract _p_-adic modular forms and corank theorem. ([notes](././3.pdf)) <br/>
_Introduce the notions of abstract classical, overconvergent and p-adic forms and the power basis on spaces of abstract over-convergent forms. Explain the theta map and Atkin-Lehner involution under the abstract setup following [LTXZ1, §3]. Prove the (general) corank theorem and explain the intuition behind the ghost multiplicities in the definition of ghost series, following [LTXZ2, §3]._

- [x] (4/14) **Bin Zhao:** Talk 4 -- Basic properties of ghost series. ([notes](././4.pdf)) <br/>
_Give the dimension formulas for the space of abstract classical forms. Following [LTXZ1, §4], explain the implications below of the dimension formulas: (a) a formula on the degrees of the coefficients of ghost series; (b) compatibility of the ghost series with theta maps, the Atkin–Lehner involutions and the p-stabilization process; (c) ghost duality of ghost series; (d) an estimate of "old form slopes"._

- [x] (4/14) **Bin Zhao:** Talk 5 -- Further properties of the ghost Newton polygon. ([notes](././5.pdf)) <br/>
_Following [LTXZ1, §5], introduce the notion of "near Steinberg range", and use it to give a criterion to detect vertices of the Newton polygon of ghost series._

- [x] (4/14) **Bin Zhao:** Talk 6 -- Integrality of slopes of ghost series at classical weights. ([notes](././6.pdf)) <br/>
_Show the integrality property of slopes of ghost series at classical weights._

- [x] (4/21) **Ruochuan Liu:** Talk 7 -- Rigidity of power series of ghost series type. ([notes](././7.pdf)) <br/>
_Follow [LTXZ2, §9] to prove the finiteness of irreducible components of the zero locus of a power series of ghost series type, and hint at the later application to finiteness of irreducible components of eigencurves._

- [x] (4/21) **Ruochuan Liu:** Talk 8 -- On triangulline deformation space and Paškūnas modules.([notes](././8.pdf)) <br/>
_Recall triangulline deformation space of Breuil–Hellmann–Schraen and discuss the crystalline slopes on it. Give a brief introduction to Paškūnas modules and local Langlands correspondence for GL(2,Qp)._

- [x] (4/21) **Liang Xiao:** Talk 9 -- Crystalline slopes on triangulline deformation spaces. ([notes](././9.pdf)) <br/>
_Translate local ghost theorem to results of crystalline slopes on triangulline deformation spaces following [LTXZ2, §7]. Follow [LTXZ2, §8] to deduce the ghost conjecture of Bergdall–Pollack from the local ghost conjecture. Then explain some arithmetic consequences, e.g. Breuil-Buzzard–Emeerton conjecture, Gouvêa conjecture, Gouvêa-Mazur conjecture, etc._

- [x] (4/21) **Bin Zhao:** Talk 10 -- Proof of local ghost conjecture I. ([notes](././10.pdf)) <br/>
_Follow [LTXZ2, §4] to explain how to explain how Lagrange interpolation can reduces the proof of local ghost conjecture to an estimate on the determinant of minors of the Up-operator on the power basis._

- [x] (4/28) **Liang Xiao:** Talk 11 -- Proof of local ghost conjecture II. ([notes](././11.pdf)) <br/>
_Follow [LTXZ2, §6] to explain how to inductively prove the needed estimate, especially the cofactor expansion argument that reduces to an estimate that will follow from inductive hypothesis._

- [x] (4/28) **Bin Zhao:** Talk 12 -- Proof of local ghost conjecture III. ([notes](././12.pdf)) <br/>
_Discuss the improved halo estimate and modified Mahler basis; follow [LTXZ2, §3]. Follow [LTXZ2, §5] to conclude the proof of local ghost conjecture, where we explain how to use the improved halo estimates to complete the inductive proof._
