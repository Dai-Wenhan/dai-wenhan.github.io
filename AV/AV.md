## Abelian Varieties (I)

_Student seminar for the 3+X program._

The goal of this learning seminar is to study the basics of abelian varieties. The pre-requisite is Chapters 2–3 of Hartshorne’s algebraic geometry, but this seminar can also be taken while reading Hartshorne’s book. Some familiarity with elliptic curves will be helpful to understand some of the materials. Each lecture will be two hours long. 

The textbook we are going to use is Mumford’s book. Another complementary reference is Milne’s online note. Mumford’s book is mostly about the geometry (i.e. abelian varieties over algebraically closed fields), while Milne’s note has more about the arithmetic (e.g. abelian varieties over finite fields or number fields). Moreover, Milne’s note has a chapter about Jacobian varieties.
- **Time**: Every Friday, 7:30-9:30pm.
- **Location**: School of Math 1418 / Jia-Yi-Bing Building.
- **Instructor**: [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm) and [Xinyi Yuan](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~yxy/).

### Announcements

#### About logistics -

1. (10/28) Free dinner will be provided from the first meeting in November, and if you need it, please pick it up directly in front of 77201 (remainder: the class will still be held on the second floor of the Jia-Yi-Bing Building and not 77201).
2. (10/7) **WATCH**: As of October 14, our meeting place was changed to **the second floor of the Jia-Yi-Bing Building** instead of the SMS 1418.

#### My collated notes are available -

[Part I](././AV(I).pdf) (analytic theory, Lecture 1-3), [Part II](././AV(II).pdf) (algebraic theory via varieties, Lecture 4-8), [Part III](././AV(III).pdf) (algebraic theory via schemes, Lecture 9-); thanks to [Bin Zhao](https://sites.google.com/site/zhaobinmath/)'s previous lecture series at YMSC in 2020.

### Syllabus (modified)

- [x] (9/9) **Liang Xiao** - Introduction and organization. Outline the materials and talk about distribution of the lectures to students. ([notes](././AV0.pdf))
- [x] (9/16) **Wenhan Dai** - [Mum, §1] This starts the complex theory of abelian varieties. ([notes](././AV1.pdf))
