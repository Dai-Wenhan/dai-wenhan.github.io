## Perfectoid Approaches to _p_-adic Modular Forms.

Let _p_ be a prime. I want to explain how to use the geometry of modular curves at infinite level and Hodge-Tate period map to study _p_-adic regular de Rham Galois representations appearing in the _p_-adically completed cohomology of modular curves. We will show that these Galois representations up to twists come from modular forms and give a geometric description of the locally analytic representations of GL(2, Q_p) associated to them. These results were previously known by totally different methods.
