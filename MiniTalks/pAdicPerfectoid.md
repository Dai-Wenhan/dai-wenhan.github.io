## Perfectoid Approaches to $p$-adic Modular Forms.

Let $p$ be a prime. I want to explain how to use the geometry of modular curves at infinite level and Hodge-Tate period map to study $p$-adic regular de Rham Galois representations appearing in the $p$-adically completed cohomology of modular curves. We will show that these Galois representations up to twists come from modular forms and give a geometric description of the locally analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}(2, \mathbb{Q}_p)$ associated to them. These results were previously known by totally different methods.
