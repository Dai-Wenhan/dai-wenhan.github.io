## Uniformly Bounded Multiplicities in the Branching Problem and $\mathfrak{D}$-modules.

In [arXiv:2109.05556](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05556), I defined uniform boundedness of a family of $\mathfrak{D}$-modules (and $\mathfrak{g}$-modules) to treat the boundedness properties uniformly. I will talk about its definition and applications. In particular, I will give a necessary and sufficient condition on uniform boundedness of multiplicities in the branching problem of real reductive Lie groups.

  - **Abstract**: In the representation theory of real reductive Lie groups, several finiteness results of lengths and multiplicities are known and fundamental. The Harish-Chandra admissibility theorem and the finiteness of the length of Verma modules and principal series representations are typical examples. <br/> More precisely, such multiplicities and lengths are bounded on some parameter sets. T. Oshima and T. Kobayashi ('13 adv. math.) gave a criterion on which branching laws have (uniformly) bounded multiplicities.
