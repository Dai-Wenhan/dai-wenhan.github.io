## On the Ternary Goldbach Problem.

_A coffee-break-seminar on additive and combinatoric number theory._

**Motivation:** The coffee bar at BICMR is used for resting or discussing problems and is equipped with comfortable sofas and wide blackboards. For tired students, this place (and especially the sofas) is extremely attractive. However, it is embarrassing to occupy the sofa for long periods of time without doing mathematics; and to make matters worse, both automorphic forms on Shimura varieties and _p_-adic Hodge theory are so difficult that tired students no longer have the energy to discuss them. So, to better occupy the comfort of the sofa, we came up with the idea of discussing Goldbach's Conjecture (so that people passing through the corridor wouldn't get the idea of chasing us away).

All over the world, there are a large number of amateur maths enthusiasts who make their own elementary and non-professional attempts at all kinds of number-theoretic conjectures. In the case of the Goldbach Problem, this phenomenon is more evident in China than elsewhere for historical reasons. This series of discussions, which took place during the coffee break, was intended to explain why the Goldbach Problem is so difficult to prove and the great difficulties that lie beneath its elementary appearance.

- **Organizers:** Zekun Chen (<chenzekun@pku.edu.cn>), Wenhan Dai (me), and Sister Xiao (<944058846@qq.com>).
- **Time:** October-November 2022; typically irregular. (Contact the organizers to join the WeChat group for detailed time syllabus.)
- **Venue:** Coffee Bar at Jingchun Yuan (behind Room 77201), BICMR; or alternatively, the Paradiso Coffee (泊星地咖啡) at Yan Yuan.
- **Prerequisite:** Analytic NT / Fourier analysis, assumedly useful but not necessary. 

We plan to follow [Ben Green's lecture notes](https://courses-archive.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/view_material/49404) (Oxon ver in 2020) closely.
