## Seminars, Workshops, and Conferences Attended

### Ongoing Events during 2023 Spring

- [**Seminar on Geometry of Shimura varieties mod _p_**](./geomShv23/geomShv23.md).

  The purpose of this weekly seminar is to study several research papers on the geometry of Shimura varieties mod _p_ as well as arithmetic applications, and hopefully forming new research ideas. All talks will be given by participants, and each meeting will be about 120 minutes.
  - **Organizer:** [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm).
  - **Time:** 16:00–18:00 Mondays (starting on February 20).
  - **Venue:** Jingchun Yuan 78301.


- [**Seminar on Lawrence–Venkatesh’s proof of the Mordell conjecture**](./LV23/LV23.md).

  The purpose of this weekly seminar is to study Lawrence–Venkatesh’s proof of the Mordell conjecture. The main reference is [LV], and the survey [Po] gives a quick sketch for beginners. All talks will be given by participants, and each meeting will be about 90 minutes.
  - **Organizer:** [Xinyi Yuan](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~yxy/).
  - **Time:** 10:30–12:00 Wednesdays (starting on March 1).
  - **Venue:** BICMR 77201.
  
- [**Abelian Varieties (II)**](./AV2/AV2.md) (Student seminar for the 3+X program; see also [**Abelian Varieties (I)**](https://dai-wenhan.github.io/AV/AV.html) during 2022 Fall).

  The goal of this learning seminar is to study the basics of abelian varieties. The pre-requisite is Chapters 2–3 of Hartshorne's algebraic geometry, but this seminar can also be taken while reading Hartshorne's book. Some familiarity with elliptic curves will be helpful to understand some of the materials. Each lecture will be two hours long.
  - **Instructor**: [Liang Xiao](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~lxiao/index.htm).
  - **Time**: Every Saturday, 7:00-9:00pm, during 2023 Spring semester.
  - **Location**: Room 82J12 (Jia-yi-bing Building).
