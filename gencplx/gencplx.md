## Complex Analysis for the Generals

**Instruction Watch:** My notes for complex analysis is available [here](././cplx.pdf). This note is intended to be written for the PhD Entrance and Qualifying Examination at the Beijing International Center of Mathematical Research in 2022. The first previous chapters do follow [SS10] loosely so that I claim no originality. Another standard reference for these notes is [Lan03]. The outline is as follows.

existence of primitives; Cauchy Integral Formula; Holomorphicity is equivalent to analyticity; The existence of complex logarithm on simply connected regions; Liouville Theorem: the rigidity of entire functions; Montel Theorem; The Mean-Value Property; The Maximum Principle; Open Mapping Theorem.
- **Meromorphic Functions** - <br/>
  Zeros and poles, local expansion near zeros and poles; The Residue Formula; Application I: evaluation of integrals; Application II: the argument principle; Rouch√© Theorem.
