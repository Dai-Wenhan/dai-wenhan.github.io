## Homological Methods in Algebraic Geometry

The main reference for this course is Huybrechtsâ€™s book _Fourier-Mukai transforms in algebraic geometry_ ([Huy06]). Besides this, we will also use parts of the following books: _Methods of homological algebra_, _An introduction to homological algebra_ and _D-modules, perverse sheaves, and representation theory_ (only the chapter of t-structures) i.e., [GM13], [Wei94], and [HT07].

- **Lecturer**: Yucheng Liu (postdoc at BICMR, <liuyucheng@bicmr.pku.edu.cn>).

**Announcement**: Dr. Liu's lecture notes are available [here](././homoalg2021.pdf). At some point in the future, I might update it randomly to correct the typos. (The latest version: February 22, 2022.)
