## Lectures on the Langlands Program.

_[IHES 2022 Summer School](https://www.ihes.fr/en/summer-school-2022/)_

- **Time:** July 11 to 29, 2022.
- **Organizers:** Pierre-Henri Chaudouard (IMJ-PRG), Wee Teck Gan (National Univ. of Singapore), Tasho Kaletha (Univ. of Michigan), and Yiannis Sakellaridis (Johns Hopkins Univ.).
- **Scientific Committee:** Gérard Laumon (Univ. Paris-Sud), Colette Mœglin (IMJ-PRG), Bảo Châu NGÔ (Chicago Univ.) and Jean-Loup Waldspurger (IMJ-PRG).


It has been almost 45 years since the influential summer school held in Corvallis, Oregon in 1977 brought together the leading experts of the Langlands program and defined the research agenda in this area for subsequent decades, at the same time inspiring and enabling several generations of young researchers to join in this exciting journey. This 3-week IHES summer school aims to do the same for the next phase of development in the Langlands program.

Recent decades have brought tremendous progress on the project of endoscopy, the extension of the Langlands program to the “relative” setting of spherical varieties and other related spaces, numerous successful “explicit” methods (such as the theta correspondence) to construct functoriality.

Ideas from the geometric Langlands program have begun impacting and enriching the classical Langlands program in significant ways. In particular, the idea that the “space of Langlands parameters” is not just a set, but a geometric space, can be used to organize a lot of developments around reciprocity.

The Summer School will attempt to bring these exciting new directions together and explore their interactions.

  _Depending on your point of view, Shimura varieties are a special kind of locally symmetric spaces, a generalization of moduli spaces of abelian schemes with extra structures, or the imperfect characteristic 0 version of moduli spaces of shtuka. They play an important role in the Langlands program because they have many symmetries (the Hecke correspondences) allowing us to link their cohomology to the theory of automorphic representations, and on the other hand they are explicit enough for this cohomology to be computable. The goal of these lectures is to give an introduction to Shimura varieties, to present some examples, and to explain the conjectures on their cohomology (at least in the simplest case)._

  _This is a follow-up to the previous session._

- **Lucas Mason-Brown** (Oxford) -- **Arthur's Conjectures and the Orbit Method for Real Reductive Groups**. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5o-C1vCuQ), [notes]()) <br/>
  _The most fundamental unsolved problem in the representation theory of Lie groups is the Problem of the Unitary Dual: given a reductive Lie group G, this problem asks for a parameterization of the set of irreducible unitary G-representations. There are two big "philosophies" for approaching this problem. The Orbit Method of Kostant and Kirillov seeks to parameterize irreducible unitary representations in terms of finite covers of co-adjoint G-orbits. Arthur's conjectures suggest a parameterization in terms of certain combinatorial gadgets (i.e. Arthur parameters) related to the Langlands dual group G^{\vee} of G. In this talk, We will define these correspondences precisely in the case of complex groups. We will also define a natural duality map from Arthur parameters (for G^{\vee}) to co-adjoint covers (for G) which, in a certain precise sense, intertwines these correspondences. This talk is partially based on joint work with Ivan Losev and Dmitryo Matvieievskyi._

- **Raphaël Beuzart-Plessis** (Univ. Aix-Marseille) -- **The Relative Langlands Program (1/3)**. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4xgPDJCymw), [notes]()) <br/>
  _Broadly interpreted, the Relative Langlands Program (RLP) is an attempt to unify those somehow disparate phenomena by systematically relating them to a dual Galois picture similar to that of the mainstream Langlands program. As we will see, it turns out that the RLP can actually be regarded as a direct enhancement of the usual LP and not merely as a separately connected subject._

#### July 18

- **Tasho Kaletha** (Univ. Michigan) -- **A Brief Introduction to the Trace Formula and its Stabilization (1/2)**. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH-C2Zm2pgM), [notes]()) <br/>
  _We will discuss the derivation of the stable Arthur-Selberg trace formula. In the first lecture we will focus on anisotropic reductive groups, for which the trace formula can be derived easily. We will then discuss the stabilization of this trace formula, which is unconditional on the geometric side, and relies on the Arthur conjectures on the spectral side. In the second lecture we will sketch the case of an arbitrary reductive group, which causes many analytic difficulties. We will briefly describe the various stops on the road to the stable trace formula, including the coarse and fine expansions of the non-invariant trace formula, as well the invariant trace formula. Examples will be given for the group SL(2). Towards the end, we will discuss the application of the stable trace formula to the classification of representations of classical groups._

- **Jared Weinstein** (Boston Univ.) -- **Local Shtukas and the Langlands Program (1/2)**. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsaPXP3p2QM), [notes](././WeinsteinM1.pdf)) <br/>
  _In the Langlands program over number fields, automorphic representations and Galois representations are placed into correspondence, using the cohomology of Shimura varieties as an intermediary. Over a function field, the appropriate intermediary is a moduli space of shtukas. We introduce the shtukas and their local analogs, which play a similar role in the local Langlands program. Along the way, we construct the Fargues-Fontaine curve and discuss perfectoid spaces and diamonds. This survey may be seen as preparatory for the lectures of Fargues-Scholze._

- **Bao Châu Ngô** (Chicago Univ.) -- **Orbital Integrals, Moduli Spaces and Invariant Theory (1/3)**. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74aq5gIDrFQ), [notes]()) <br/>
  _The goal of these lectures is to sketch a general framework to study orbital integrals over equal characteristic local fields by means of moduli spaces of Hitchin type following the main lines of the proof of the fundamental lemma for Lie algebras. After recalling basic elements of the proof of the fundamental lemma for Lie algebras as well as recent related developments, we will explain an invariant theoretic construction which should a basic tool to understand general orbital integrals._

  _Cohomology sheaves and cohomology groups of stacks of shtukas are used in the Langlands program for function fields. We will explain (1) how the Eichler-Shimura relations imply the finiteness property of the cohomology groups, (2) how the finiteness and Drinfeld's lemma imply the action of the Weil group of the function field on the cohomology groups, and (3) how this action and the "Zorro lemma" imply the smoothness of the cohomology sheaves. The smoothness will be used in Sam Raskin’s lecture._

  _We have seen in the first week of the summer school that the buildings blocks for irreducible representations of p-adic groups are the supercuspidal representations. In these talks we will explore explicit exhaustive constructions of these supercuspidal representations and their character formulas and observe a striking parallel between a large class of these representations in the p-adic world and discrete series representations of real algebraic Lie groups. A key ingredient for the construction of supercuspidal representations is the Bruhat-Tits theory and Moy-Prasad filtration, which we will introduce in the lecture series._

  _We discuss various generalizations of the Gross-Zagier formula to high-dimensional Shimura varieties, with an emphasis on the AGGP conjecture and the relative trace formula approach. Roughly the first lecture will be devoted to the global aspect and the second one to the local aspect._

- **David Ben-Zvi** (UT Austin) -- **Between Coherent and Constructible Local Langlands Correspondences**. ([video](https://youtu.be/iN2AAiiRUVI), [notes]()) <br/>
  _(Joint with Harrison Chen, David Helm, and David Nadler.) Refined forms of the local Langlands correspondence seek to relate representations of reductive groups over local fields with sheaves on stacks of Langlands parameters. But what kind of sheaves? Conjectures in the spirit of Kazhdan-Lusztig theory describe representations of a group and its pure inner forms with fixed central character in terms of constructible sheaves. Conjectures in the spirit of geometric Langlands describe representations with varying central character of a large family of groups associated to isocrystals in terms of coherent sheaves. The latter conjectures also take place on a larger parameter space, in which Frobenius (or complex conjugation) is allowed a unipotent part. In this talk, we propose a general mechanism that interpolates between these two settings. This mechanism derives from the theory of cyclic homology, as interpreted through circle actions in derived algebraic geometry. We apply this perspective to categorical forms of the local Langlands conjectures for both archimedean and non-archimedean local fields. In the archimedean case, we explain a conjectural realization of coherent local Langlands as geometric Langlands on the twistor line, the real counterpart of the Fargues-Fontaine curve, and its relation to constructible local Langlands via circle actions. In the non-archimedean case, we describe how circle actions relate coherent and constructible realizations of affine Hecke algebras and of all smooth representations of GL(n), and propose a mechanism to relate the two settings in general._

- **Tony Feng** (MIT) -- **Derived Aspects of the Langlands Program (1/3)**. ([video](https://youtu.be/W8hAZP36-c4), [notes]()) <br/>
  _We discuss ways in which derived structures have recently emerged in connection with the Langlands correspondence, with an emphasis on derived Galois deformation rings and derived Hecke algebras._

- **Yiannis Sakellaridis** (Johns Hopkins Univ.) -- **Local and Global Questions "Beyond Endoscopy" (1/2)**. ([video](https://youtu.be/NjUdyYE4vBM), [notes]()) <br/>
  _The near completion of the program of endoscopy poses the question of what lies next. These talks will take a broad view of ideas beyond the program of endoscopy, highlighting the connections among them, and emphasizing the relationship between local and global aspects. Central among those ideas is the one proposed in a 2000 lecture of R. P. Langlands, aiming to extract from the stable trace formula of a group G the bulk of those automorphic representations in the image of the conjectural functorial lift corresponding to a morphism of L-groups. With the extension of the problem of functionality to the "relative" setting of spherical varieties and related spaces, some structure behind such comparisons has started to reveal itself. In a seemingly unrelated direction, a program initiated by Braverman-Kazhdan, also around 2000, to generalize the Godement-Jacquet proof of the functional equation to arbitrary L-functions, has received renewed attention in recent years. We survey ideas and developments in this direction, as well, and discuss the relationship between the two programs._
