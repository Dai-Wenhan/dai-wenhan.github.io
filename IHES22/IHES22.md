## Lectures on the Langlands Program.

_[IHES 2022 Summer School](https://www.ihes.fr/en/summer-school-2022/)_

- **Time**: July 11 to 29, 2022.
- **Organizers**: Pierre-Henri Chaudouard (IMJ-PRG), Wee Teck Gan (National Univ. of Singapore), Tasho Kaletha (Univ. of Michigan), and Yiannis Sakellaridis (Johns Hopkins Univ.).
- **Scientific Committee**: Gérard Laumon (Univ. Paris-Sud), Colette Mœglin (IMJ-PRG), Bảo Châu NGÔ (Chicago Univ.) and Jean-Loup Waldspurger (IMJ-PRG).
- **List of Participants**: see on the [list file](././ParticipantsList.pdf).

It has been almost 45 years since the influential summer school held in Corvallis, Oregon in 1977 brought together the leading experts of the Langlands program and defined the research agenda in this area for subsequent decades, at the same time inspiring and enabling several generations of young researchers to join in this exciting journey. This 3-week IHES summer school aims to do the same for the next phase of development in the Langlands program.

Recent decades have brought tremendous progress on the project of endoscopy, the extension of the Langlands program to the “relative” setting of spherical varieties and other related spaces, numerous successful “explicit” methods (such as the theta correspondence) to construct functoriality.

Ideas from the geometric Langlands program have begun impacting and enriching the classical Langlands program in significant ways. In particular, the idea that the “space of Langlands parameters” is not just a set, but a geometric space, can be used to organize a lot of developments around reciprocity.

The Summer School will attempt to bring these exciting new directions together and explore their interactions.

#### July 11

- **Organizers** - **Warm-up Introduction**. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZOVszZ9ZVs), [captions](././Intro.pdf)) <br/>
  Organizers' answers to: What is the Langlands Program? Why a summer school on the Langlands Program in 2022? What do you hope to achieve during these three weeks?

- **Olivier Taïbi** (ENS Lyon) - **The Local Langlands Conjecture** (1/3). ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJwLV6SZ8Fc), [live-TeXed notes](././Taibi1.pdf)) <br/>
  We formulate the local Langlands conjecture for connected reductive groups over local fields, including the internal parametrization of _L_-packets.

- **Erez Lapid** (Weizmann Institute) - **Some Perspective on Eisenstein Series** (1/2). ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0yblUboBeM), [live-TeXed notes](././Lapid1.pdf)) <br/>
  This is a review of some developments in the theory of Eisenstein series since Corvallis. 
  - _It seems that some unusual beast appeared in his talk. This [expository writing](././Lapid0.pdf) contains a relatively mild introduction to the background._

- **Olivier Taïbi** (ENS Lyon) - **The Local Langlands Conjecture** (2/3). ([video](), [live-TeXed notes](././Taibi2.pdf)) <br/>
  This is a follow-up to the morning session.

- **Sophie Morel** (ENS Lyon) - **Shimura Varieties** (1/3). ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIZdWvMJN34), [live-TeXed notes](././Morel1.pdf), [manuscript](././MorelM1.pdf)) <br/>
  Depending on your point of view, Shimura varieties are a special kind of locally symmetric spaces, a generalization of moduli spaces of abelian schemes with extra structures, or the imperfect characteristic 0 version of moduli spaces of shtuka. They play an important role in the Langlands program because they have many symmetries (the Hecke correspondences) allowing us to link their cohomology to the theory of automorphic representations, and on the other hand they are explicit enough for this cohomology to be computable. The goal of these lectures is to give an introduction to Shimura varieties, to present some examples, and to explain the conjectures on their cohomology (at least in the simplest case).
