## Elementary Number Theory (in English).

During the Summer of 2022, I offered a basic course on _Topics in Elementary Number Theory_ for first-year high school students, in response to a request for preparing the Chinese National High School Mathematics League in 2023. At the end of the course, for the convenience of the AMC/AIME/AHSME/USAMO participants, the lecture notes will be translated into English, collated into a number of documents, and gradually uploaded onto this page.
