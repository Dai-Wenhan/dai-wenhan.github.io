## Lecture Series on Elementary Number Theory (in English).

In the winter of 2022, I offered a course on _Topics in Elementary Number Theory_ for second-year high school students who were not selected for the national training team but had the potential to do so, in response to a request from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University for an international mathematical Olympiad. At the end of the course, the lecture notes are collated into a number of documents and gradually uploaded to this page.
