## Lecture Series on Elementary Number Theory (in English).

In the winter of 2022, I offer a course on _Topics in Elementary Number Theory_ for second-year high school students who would not pass the Chinese Team Selection Test but have the potential to do so, in response to a request from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University for preparing the International Mathematical Olympiad in 2023. At the end of the course, the lecture notes will be translated into English, collated into a number of documents, and gradually uploaded onto this page.
