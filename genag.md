## Algebraic Geometry for the Generals

**Instruction Watch**: This page mainly covers the algebraic geometry necessary to pass the graduate's general qualifying examinations at BICMR (and possibly other universities and institutes say). Whether you are preparing for an interview or a written test, refering to my notes can be helpful. All primary topics that have occured in Chapter II and III of Robin Hartshorne's [_Algebraic Geometry_](https://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Geometry-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387902449) are contained somewhere.

My solutions of Hartshorne's exercises are attached as well whereas I claim no originality of them. Solving these problems was a laborious and painful process, but going through those problems did force me to learn all the technical commutative algebra, as well as many techniques in algebraic geometry. Therefore, I seriously urge you to use these solutions carefully; the best way to solve problems is always through one's own thinking.
